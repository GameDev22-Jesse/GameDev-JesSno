<div id="div1">
<h3> 2000</h3>
<p>The S1-Pro was released as the first consumer-level DSLR with a 3 megapixel sensor and a Nikon film body. It was listed as $3,500 
    instead of $10,000+, and a few months later, the DSLR became more defining than the film cameras, which only had 2 megapixel CCD sensors 
    and went through AA batteries rapidly. 
</p>
<br>
<h3> 2004</h3>
<p> The Epson R-D1 was the first to become a mirrorless camera and have am electronic viewfinder at the cost of having large sensors and a 
    poor battery life. 
</p> 
<br>
<h3> 2008</h3>
<p> The EOS 5D MARK II was a high-definition video camera for less than $3,000, which revolutionized the film industry by allowing high 
    quality video cameras available to more. 
<br>
This was the same year that Apple produced their first iPhone, which had a rear facing camera of 2 megapixels and a video quality of 640x480 
pixels that recorded at 30 frames per second. It is not much compared to now, but it was a massive step in the right direction. 
</p>
<br>
<h3> 2010</h3>
<p> Although the film industry was clearly moving into the digital era, the most affordable for most people was still film. Fuji Velvia 50 
    specifically was one of the most used film around this time. 
</p>
<br>
<h3> 2022 </h3>
<p> Apple has been producing multiple versions of their iPhone ever since 2008, each being better or different than the last, and the iPhone 
    available to consumers in 2022 is the iPhone 13 Pro. <br>
    It contains:
    <ul>
    <li>Aperture options of f/1.5, f/1.8, and f/2.8. </li> 
    <li>A zoom up to 15x. </li>
    <li>A Night Mode option for shooting photos or videos at night or in dark spaces. </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br><br>

<h3> Tools <i>Then</i> Compared to <i>Now</i></h3> 
<p>Tools then consist mostly of those listed above pre-2022, film being one of the most easily recognizable tools of pre-2022. 
<br>
Tools now consist of:
<ul>
    <li>External Flashes</li>
    <li>Memory Cards</li>
    <li>External Hard Drives</li>
</ul>
In 2022, camera manufacturers really pushed the idea of us entering the digital era. 
</p> 
<br>
<br>
<h3>Changes in Methods</h3>
<h4>Methods then:</h4>
<ul>
    <li><u>Portraits</u></li>
    <p>Portraits were very popular with the iPhone out, which were equipped with portable cameras. </p>
    <li><u>Realism</u></li>
    <p>Realism photography captured life and showed it to viewers in a way that they never saw before and showed people different 
        cultures and ways of looking at things. </p>
    <li><u>Historical Events</u></li>
    <p>Historical events are always popular, but increased in popularity when World War 2 occured. </p>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Methods now:</h4> 
<ul>
    <li><u>Masked Up</u></li>
    <p>With the pandemic occuring and spreading rapidly, photos are crucial to show people how it is effecting our society. </p>
    <li><u>Aerial</u></li>
    <p>New technology that is available to everyone is being used to capture photos of the land from the sky without the use of planes or 
        aircrafts. 
    </p>
    <li><u>Astrophotography</u></li>
    <p>Newer cameras are allowing people to take photos of space, allowing astronomers and astronauts to further discover and research it
        without actually going to space and risking lives. </p>
    <li><u>Event</u></li>
    <p>People are still taking pictures of occurences since it is vital to record our history and spread information as wide as possible. </p> 
    <li><u>Macro</u></li>
    <p>With high definition cameras being available and able to manufacture, people are taking pictures of microscopic organisms to study
        how they work. </p>
    <li><u>Sports</u></li>
    <p>With a high shutter speed, cameras allow us to capture moments you would only see in a split second and allow us to further examine
        the moment to its finest detail. </p>
    <li><u>Travel</u></li>
    <p>Travel photography allows people to see whole different parts of the world without actually going there, and that also brings them 
        information for them to use when deciding where they could go and how they would get there. </p>
    <li><u>Wildlife</u></li>
    <p>Since there is no 100% safe way to watch and see how animals in the wild interact with each other, cameras with far zooms and 
        professionals who are able to track animals are able to take photos and allow us to see them, when otherwise we wouldn't be able to. </p>
    <li><u>Still Life</u></li>
    <p>With a wider array of options on cameras allowing you to affect how long the shutter is open before it closes lets us take photos of
        things that would usually be moving and seemingly be stopped in time, with little to no motion blur. </p>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<h3>How's it changed photography?</h3>
<p>iPhone cameras and DSLR cameras allow photographers to take clearer pictures faster, which allows them to review their photos instantly. 
<br>
Photo editing allows photographers to ensure they will get the picture they want, or to manipulate a photo to look the way they want it to look.

<div id="div1">
<h3>Major Social, Political, and Environmental Photographic Events </h3>
<p>Major social, political, and environmental events have been captured by photographers and have been recorded in history books all over 
    the world. <br> 
    These photographers have been able to capture events such as: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Barack Obama becoming president</u></li>
        <p>This was a massive step in political history as there has never been a black president before. </p>
        <li><u>The Death of George Floyd</u> </li>
        <p>The death of George Floyd showed the people of America that there was still discrimination present, and photography allowed that 
            information to spread rapidly throughout the country, and even to neighboring countries. </p>
        <li><u>The Rise of COVID-19</u> </li> 
        <p>Photography allowed the whole world to gain information about COVID-19 and how dangerous and lethal it is. It also allowed doctors
            and scientists alike to work together in figuring out how to create a vaccine faster than anyone has ever been created before. </p>
        <li><u>The Ukraine-Russia War (and potential world war)</u> </li> 
        <p>Photography of the war between Russia and Ukraine allowed people to see what was happening across the world and support Ukraine 
            any way they can. Photos of the ongoing war also allowed offials from countries to finally decide if it is worth joining the war.
        Not only that, but this is a potential World War 3 happening in the 21st century. </p>
    </ul>
<br>
<h3>Impact of Photographic Media</h3>
<p>
    The impact of photography has allowed people to access photos from all over the world at different points in time, photos being less 
    expensive to produce and easier to make made pictures able to be mass produced and shown to multiple people at once, which changed how 
    any news was recorded, stored, or retrieved, which changed how people felt and reacted to the news or any new information that was able 
    to be brought to us.

<h2 class="subtitle"><u>Purpose of Photographs (to Individuals)</u></h2>

<h3>Photograpy on an Individual Level </h3>
<p>Photography allows us to remember or be remembered for generations to come. This technology is available to almost everyone, unlike before 
    where it was only available to the rich and the wealthy. <br>
Photos allow us to remember events or memories that we may have forgotten. </p>
<br>
<h3>The <i>How, Where</i> and <i>Why</i> of Photographs and their Purpose</h3>
<h4><i><u>How</u></i></h4>
<p>
    A DSLR  camera works by letting light into the camera through the lens, reflected off a mirror inside the cameras body, and through 
    another mirror that leads the light to the viewfinder, where you can see the what photo the camera will be taking. The picture isnâ€™t taken 
    until the shutter button is pressed and moves the mirror out of the way to the imaging sensor.
</p>
<h4><i><u>Where</u></i></h4>
<p>
    A photo can be taken anywhere there is light, and there is even light in space, so you are literally only limited by your imagination. 
    <br><br>
    Taking a picture:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><u>Outdoors:</u></li>
<p>
    The purpose of outdoor photography is to capture the baeuty of the great outdoors. Your photo captures the mood, scenery, and setting of 
    your focused subject.
</p>
    <li><u>Indoors:</u></li>
<p>
    The purpose of indoor photography is to continue to shoot photos inside th comfort of your own home on a rainy day or to protect your 
    equipment from harsh weather. Indoor photography also works great when wanting to work with ambient space. 
</p>
    <li><u>In Space:</u></li>
    <p>
        Astrophotography means to take pictures of space and everything in/around it. The purpose of taking such photos is to help astronomers 
        learn more about a planet or star's atmosphere, life support capability, and predict changes in space and weather. Space photography is 
        required when understanding the composition and fate of our universe.  
    </p>
</ul>
<br>
<h4><i><u>Why</u></i></h4>
<p>
    They are confirmations of our personal experiences and showcase said experiences from our point of view. Photos are taken as a way to tell 
    a story, as a way to  reflect on who we and others are, but people take pictures for all types of reasons, ranging from keeping a certain 
    feeling to remembering a life event.
</p>
<br>
<h3>My Thoughts on Different Types of Photography</h3>
<p>
    I think the changes of photography have made a huge difference. <br>
    There are constantly more ways to take photos coming out and becoming available to people worldwide. 
    People are no longer being limited to what they can take photos of. Handheld cameras are rapidly becoming better and soon you can have the 
    properties and functions of a full handheld camera in a phone that you could fit in your pocket. 
</p>
<br>
<h3> The Impact of Photography To Individuals</h3>
<p>
    Photography allows you to take a step into someone elseâ€™s shoes, see the struggles they are going through, happiness, and sadness. It's 
    easier to interpret someoneâ€™s facial emotions from a picture than just words. Pictures help shape our thoughts and feelings about life, 
    often trying to motivate others to change their approach or decisions.

<div id="div1">
<h3>Photographs Remain a Great Way to Capture an Event</h3>
<p>
    Photographs are a way to capture moments that you may forget later on and potentially forget. Being able to capture these events lets you 
    re-live them years later. 
These events and/or memories can also be shared to family and friends. Depending on how well they are taken care of, they could last lifetimes 
and tell stories for generations. 
</p>
<br>
<h3>Why Photographs Matter</h3>
<p>
    Photographs tell us what is important. They are our personal story that keep track of our lives, letting us remember the looks of the faces 
    and places we love, and even letting us share them with others. The photos we take form a narrative of our lives. <br>
Photographs help form and create our legacy. It freezes a moment of our lives so we can look back at it, even if at the moment it didn't seem 
to matter. <br>
They allow us to share our life with others, along with what we find beautiful. <br>
Creating a photograph allows us to become artists. No matter what we take a picture of or how we take the picture, we are creating something 
that is unique to us in our own way. It may not look different from other's, but to us, each photograph has a specific meaning behind it. The 
meaning behind a photograph alone is enough to make anyone an artist, not even the photograph itself. <br>
Taking photographs is a good way to express how one might feel at a certain time or place. They are an excellent way to deal with emotions one 
might be going through, or to express them onto someone else. <br>
Photography speaks to our emotions, allows us to tell a story in as few words as possible, most of the time none, and shows our framing of 
the world around us.
</p>
<br>
<h3>A Wolrd Without Photos</h3>
<p>
    If we had no photos at all, we wouldn't be able to tell how people were like when they were alive or how they felt in the moment, or 
    during an event. Drawings or illustrations would of course then become the best choice for demonstrating how a moment or event was 
    unfolding, but drawings can easily be manipulated by the artist, photos are true representations of life, for all they capture is where 
    there is light and how it bounces off of the materials or whatever the subject is made up of. Photos are able to capture and show us what 
    life was like before and how life could be after said events.
